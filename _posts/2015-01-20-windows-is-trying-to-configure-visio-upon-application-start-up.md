This post is not related to anything programming :) In my system, when launching Visio, the application will pause while displaying "Please wait while Windows configures Microsoft Visio". And after sometime, it shows the main window.

I tried repair, but it was not working. Today I found a similar Microsoft Support article - [2685120](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2685120). And the solution worked for me :)

This can be caused by the [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.vsd] key not being equal to "Visio.Drawing.11" or equal to "VisioViewer.Viewer" if you have Visio Viewer Installed. To fix this error, change the value to "Visio.Drawing.11" or "VisioViewer.Viewer".

But still I will say, Happy Programming :D
