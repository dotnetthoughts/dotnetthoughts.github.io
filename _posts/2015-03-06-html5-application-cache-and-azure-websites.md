Today I faced any issue with HTML5 Application Cache (I will post about HTML5 Application Cache later), I deployed an HTML5 application to azure website, but I was getting error like this



>Application Cache Error event: Manifest fetch failed (404)



![Application Cache Error event: Manifest fetch failed (404)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/03/manifesterror.png)

This issue was due to the MIME type mapping was missing. Since it is website, developers don't have direct control over the IIS. Here is the fix, using Web.Config file.
{% highlight XML %}
<system.webServer>
  <staticContent>
    <remove fileExtension=".appcache" />
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".appcache" 
              mimeType="text/cache-manifest" />
  </staticContent>
</system.webServer>
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes we will get this issue while running in IIS Express as well.

Happy Programming :)
