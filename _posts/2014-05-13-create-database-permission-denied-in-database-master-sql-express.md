Long back I wrote a post about [Entity Framework Error â€“ The underlying provider failed on Open](http://www.dotnetthoughts.net/?p=3775). Yesterday some one told me, he is getting this error - CREATE DATABASE permission denied in database â€˜masterâ€™, he is using an application pool with NETWORK SERVICE identity. Here is the solution, you require SysAdmin Role for "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" to resolve this issue.

Happy Programming :)
