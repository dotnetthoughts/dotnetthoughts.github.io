Today while publishing a web application I got a strange error like this from Visual Web Developer express. 



>The target "GatherAllFilesToPublish" does not exist in the project.



![he target â€œGatherAllFilesToPublishâ€ does not exist in the project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2013/06/webpublisherror.png)

Web publishing was working without any problems, only reason was I have installed Windows Azure SDK. Then found the solution, thanks to Google. Here is the solution.



*   Rename the Microsoft.WebApplication.targets to Microsoft.WebApplication.targets.old
*   Install/Repair using the exe at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=253458](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=253458)


After installation you may need to restart Visual Studio / System. It worked for me without any restart.

Happy Programming
