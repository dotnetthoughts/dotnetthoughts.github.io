This post is about how to use Angular 4 with ASP.NET MVC5. In one of my existing projects we were using Angular 1.x, due to some plugin compatibility issues, we had to migrate to latest version of Angular. We couldn't find any good article which talks about development and deployment aspects of Angular 4 with ASP.NET MVC. 

The pre-requisites are 

* npm (Node Package Manager) - I am using npm version 5.5.1
* Angular CLI - I am using angular cli version 1.5.3
* Visual Studio 2017 / 2015 - For developing ASP.NET MVC project.

First you need to create ASP.NET MVC project.

![MVC - Solution Explorer]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/mvc_solution_explorer.png)

Once you created the project, using Angular CLI you need to create Angular project. You need to do it in the root folder. And you need to execute following commands to create an Angular project.

{% highlight Shell %}
ng new HelloAngular
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a folder with name `HelloAngular`. And it contains all the required files for Angular project. Here is the folder structure after creating the angular project.

Here is the updated folder structure after creating the Angular project.

![MVC - With Angular project]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/mvc_solution_explorer_angular.png)

Unlike earlier versions of Angular, you need to reference the generated files with Angular CLI. You can generate the build files using `ng build` command. Before executing the ng build command, you need to configure your output folder, the scripts will be generated to the configured folder, by default it will be `dist`. I am configuring it to `../Bundles` folder. 

![Modified Angular cli json file]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/angularcli_json_file.png)

Next you need to run `ng build` command. Once you run the command, it will generate required files to the bundles folder.

![ng build command]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/ng_build_command.png)

Next you need to open `index.html` under bundles folder, you need to copy the script and style references from the file and add it to the _layout.cshtml file. I am using the ASP.NET MVC bundling and minification framework for this. Here is the code snippet for that. 

{% highlight CSharp %}
public class BundleConfig
{
    public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
    {
        bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/Script/Bundles")
                .Include(
                "~/bundles/inline.*",
                "~/bundles/polyfills.*",
                "~/bundles/scripts.*",
                "~/bundles/vendor.*",
                "~/bundles/main.*"));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And here is my _layout.cshtml file.

{% highlight HTML %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World - ASP.NET MVC</title>
</head>
<body>
    @RenderBody()
    @Scripts.Render("~/Script/Bundles")
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Now you have completed the initial infrastructure.

If you notice, I have removed the Bootstrap reference from _layout file. You can add it via `.angular-cli.json` file. First you need to install JQuery, Popper JS and Bootstrap 4 via `npm install` command. Once you installed it, you can modify the file like this.

![angular-cli.json Styles and Script reference]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/angularcli_json_ref.png)

Again you can run the `ng build` command, which ideally should bundles the scripts and styles we configured in the `.angular-cli.json` file. 

![ng build command]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/ng_build_command_no_css.png)

If notice, even though we added the style reference, `ng build` command didn't generated any css files. You need to provide `-ec` command line parameter to `ng build` command. This will generate the styles.

![ng build command with -ec parameter]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/ng_build_command_css.png)

Now you can modify your bundleconfig file like this, including the style reference.

{% highlight CSharp %}
bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/Content/Styles")
    .Include("~/bundles/styles.*"));
{% endhighlight %}

And _layout file like this.

{% highlight HTML %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World - ASP.NET MVC</title>
    @Styles.Render("~/Content/Styles")
</head>
<body>
    <main role="main" class="container">
        @RenderBody()
    </main>
    @Scripts.Render("~/Script/Bundles")
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can run the ASP.NET MVC application to view the results. 

You can run the `ng build --prod` command to make your script file minified, which is required to deploy the application in server. You don't need `-ec` parameter to generate the styles. Also the `--prod` parameter will reduce the file size as well.

![ng build command with --prod parameter]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/11/ng_build_command_prod.png)

You can find the difference of file sizes.

Next you can modify the project file to automate the deployment. You need to edit your project file. For that first you need to unload the project by right clicking on the project node and select `Unload Project` option. Then select the `Edit HelloWorldApp.csproj`. Next add the following code inside the project element.

{% highlight XML %}
<Target Name="NgDebug" BeforeTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'">
  <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)HelloAngular" Command="ng build -ec" />
</Target>
<Target Name="NgRelease" BeforeTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
  <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(ProjectDir)HelloAngular" Command="ng build --prod" />
</Target>
{% endhighlight %}

The above code will execute `ng build -ec` and `ng build --prod` commands based on the Visual Studio configuration. If the configuration is Debug, I will be executing the `ng build -ec` command and for Release configuration I am executing the `ng build --prod` command.

Next reload the project and build it. You will be able to see the `ng build` command output in the output window of Visual Studio.

That's it. Now you can add modules and components to angular application and you can debug it with chrome developer tools.

Happy Programming :)
