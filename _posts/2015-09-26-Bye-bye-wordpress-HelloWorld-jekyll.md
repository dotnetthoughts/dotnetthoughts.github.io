Due to some technical issues, I am migrating [my blog](http://dotnetthoughts.net) from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I am trying to migrate old posts as well, but I am not sure. 
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Initially I thought of creating the blog again in Azure, but I am using MSDN
subscription from my company, so I thought of using some other and I found github pages, where I created my page long back.
