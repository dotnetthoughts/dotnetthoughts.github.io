In this post we will explore the ASP.NET 5 Yeoman generator. What is Yeoman? Yeoman is a set of tools that facilitates building web applications. To use Yeoman, you need to install nodejs and yo package. So here is the installation steps for ASP.NET 5 Yeoman generator.



*   Install Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   Once node installed, you can install Yo using npm. - `npm install -g yo`
*   After installing yo, you need to install ASP.NET 5 generator using `npm install -g generator-aspnet` command.

You can follow the steps to create a ASP.NET 5 project using Yeoman Generator

Once complete Yeoman Generator generates the project and you can execute the DNVM commands to restore the packages and host the application in the development server (WebListener). You need to install "dnu restore" first, then execute "dnx . web" command, it will restore the packages and host the application in http://localhost:5000. Here is the output. You can get the URL from config.ini file or project.json file.
