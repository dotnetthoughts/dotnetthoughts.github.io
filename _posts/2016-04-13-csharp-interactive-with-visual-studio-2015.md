Visual Studio 2015 update 1 comes with C# interactive window. C# interactive window is a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) with advanced editor support. It supports features like IntelliSense as well as the ability to redefine functions & classes. After entering a code snippet--which can contain class and function definitions at top-level along with statements--the code executes directly.

You need VS 2015 update 1 or update 2 to use this feature. Once you have one of these versions installed, navigate to View > Other Windows > C# Interactive. This will bring up the Interactive Window.
