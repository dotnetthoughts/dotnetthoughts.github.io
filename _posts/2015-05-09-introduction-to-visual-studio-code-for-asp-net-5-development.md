In Build 2015, Microsoft introduced cross platform code editor. You can download Visual Studio code from <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/D/5/0D57186C-834B-463A-AECB-BC55A8E466AE/VSCodeSetup.exe" target="_blank">here</a>

This post is about features of Visual Studio code for ASP.NET 5 development.

Visual Studio code supports Intellisense with the help of <a href="http://www.omnisharp.net/" target="_blank">Omnisharp</a>, Visual Studio code support full intellisense. Unlike Sublime or Brackets, you don't need to worry about installing and starting Omnisharp server, VS code will do it automatically. You require either solution file(*.sln) or project.json file for C# Intellisense.

VS Code also detects changes in the project.json file and ask you to restore the packages. NuGet reference management and prompting for package restore is a new feature, which is not available in Sublime or any other similar editors.
