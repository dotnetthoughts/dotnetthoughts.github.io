This post is about a Visual Studio extension - SonarLint, which helps to write better code. Few months back I wrote few blog posts about Sonaq Qube - a code review tool. SonarLint is also from the Sonarsource team.

SonarLint is a Visual Studio 2015 extension that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into .NET code. SonarLint is based on and benefits from the .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") and its code analysis API to provide a fully-integrated user experience in Visual Studio 2015.Latest version of SonarLint is 1.5, which contains 12 C# and 10 Visual Basic .NET rules. You can download the extension from  [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/47d1049d-bb27-454e-aab8-24566c85e548) and you can get more information about SonarLint from [http://vs.sonarlint.org](http://vs.sonarlint.org)

Happy Programming
