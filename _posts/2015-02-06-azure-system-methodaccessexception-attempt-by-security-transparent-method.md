Today I faced a strange issue, after publishing an empty ASP.NET MVC application to Azure WebSite. 

When I tried to browse the page I got an exception like this - 



>Attempt by security transparent method 'System.Web.WebPages.Administration.SiteAdmin.RegisterAdminModule()' to access security critical method 'System.Web.WebPages.ApplicationPart..ctor(System.Reflection.Assembly, System.String)' failed.



Here is the screenshot

This issue was resolved by changing the file publish options.

![File Publish Options]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/02/publishsettings.png)

Select the "Remove additional files at destination" checkbox. 

Happy Programming :)
