Unlike IIS Server, IIS Express doesn't support Windows Authentication by default. You can enable the Windows Authentication in IIS Express by modifying the applicationhost.config under the "C:\Users\[username]\Documents\IISExpress\config" directory. You need to find the windowsAuthentication element under authentication, and change the value of attribute enabled to true.

Happy Programming.
