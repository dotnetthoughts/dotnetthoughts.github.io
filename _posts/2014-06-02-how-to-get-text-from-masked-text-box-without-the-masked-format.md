Today I saw some SO question asked about how to get values from Masked Textbox without the masked format. For those who don't know what is [masked textbox](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.maskedtextbox.aspx) - Uses a mask to distinguish between proper and improper user input.

![Masked Textbox - With Phone Number mask property]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2014/06/Masked-Textbox.png)

Here is the code snippet. 

{% highlight CSharp %}
//Make sure user completed the entry.
if (txtPhone.MaskFull)
{
    txtPhone.TextMaskFormat = MaskFormat.ExcludePromptAndLiterals;
    MessageBox.Show(txtPhone.Text);
    txtPhone.TextMaskFormat = MaskFormat.IncludePromptAndLiterals;
}
{% endhighlight %}


Happy Coding :)
