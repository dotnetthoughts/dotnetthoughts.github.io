Another K-MUG UG Meeting, as usual the event was awesome. (Sorry I forgot to post about the event in my blog.) The first session was from [Shiju Vargheese](http://weblogs.asp.net/shijuvarghese/) on Windows Azure Websites. A good introduction session about Windows Azure website. You can download / view the presentation [here](http://www.slideshare.net/shijucv/windows-azure-webs-sites) The second session was from [Yanesh Tyagi](http://yaneshtyagi.com/). His session was about productivity tools & tips for visual studio 2010. He discussed various keyboard shortcuts and few visual studio extensions. You can download the presentation from [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/yaneshtyagi/archive/2013/01/19/k-mug-presentation-on-visual-studio-productivity-tips.aspx) The next planned session was from Anoop Madhusoodhanan, on WinRT / Windows8 via C#, but it didn't happened. Instead [Praseed Pai](http://praseedp.blogspot.in/), another K-MUG speaker and technology enthusiast, took another session on Modern JavaScript development. Another nice session from him. And thanks to the live demo.

Thanks to [Orion India Systems](http://www.orioninc.com/) for their continuous support to promote such technology events and initiatives in Kerala. This time they supported the event by providing their training hall in Infopark, notepad, pen and a surprise gift â€“ a cute mug for the desktop.
